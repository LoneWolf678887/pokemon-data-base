<h2 class="in">Ash Ketchum</h2>
<p class="ans">
Ash Ketchum is the main protagonist of the Pokémon anime series. His journey begins in Pallet Town, where he dreams of becoming a Pokémon Master. At age 10, he receives his first Pokémon, Pikachu, and sets out on a quest to compete in Pokémon Leagues across various regions.
</p>
<p class="ans">
Over the years, Ash travels through regions like Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Galar, making friends, battling rivals, and capturing new Pokémon. He consistently grows stronger, showing deep bonds with his Pokémon and a strong sense of determination and fairness.
</p>
<p class="ans">
Ash Ketchum’s ultimate dream has always been to become a Pokémon Master, not just a World Champion. While he achieved a major milestone by becoming the World Champion after defeating Leon in the Masters Eight Tournament, that was portrayed as a step toward his larger goal—not the final destination.
</p>
<p class="ans">
As of the conclusion of the Pokémon Journeys series, Ash begins a new, open-ended journey, continuing to explore what it truly means to be a Pokémon Master—a concept that's more about the bond between Trainer and Pokémon than just battling strength.
</p>
<p class="ans">
The Pokémon Company has also suggested that Ash may return in future series or special episodes, keeping the door open for his story to evolve further.
